/**
 * Toolset gating for the ClickUp MCP server.
 *
 * Every registered tool's JSON Schema is published to the client on connect —
 * all 158 of them, ~158KB, re-sent on every reconnect. Clients that bridge a
 * local server to a remote session (Claude Desktop's remote-tools bridge) pay
 * that cost on each connection rotation, and the definitions occupy context
 * before the first prompt.
 *
 * Most workflows need a fraction of the surface. `CLICKUP_TOOLSETS` narrows it:
 *
 *   CLICKUP_TOOLSETS=tasks,comments,custom-fields,attachments,lists,bulk
 *
 * Unset, empty, or `all` keeps every toolset, so existing installs are
 * unaffected.
